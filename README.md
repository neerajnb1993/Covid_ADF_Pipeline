# Covid_ADF_Pipeline
1. This is an ETL project where I have extracted COVID data from ADLS gen 2 and performed transformations on the data and loaded the transformed data to a presentable layer for further analysis.
2. To automate this, I used ADF to build a pipeline with various activities such as notbook, copy, get_metadata, for each, and so on.
3. Finally, I have deployed the Adf pipeline into the git repo.
